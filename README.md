# Clonazon – E-Commerce Clone Project (Frontend)

**Clonazon** is an **e-commerce clone project**, inspired by the UI of Amazon, and has been built with **React + Vite**.
The idea is to recreate some of the familiar features of modern shopping platforms — including a dynamic homepage, interactive product cards, and a responsive cart interface.

- This project is built purely for **learning and educational purposes only** and is **not associated with Amazon or any other company.**.

The primary objective of this project is **skill enhancement**.
Cloning a real-world e-commerce application gives me the opportunity to dive deeper into **frontend development**, while preparing to expand into **full-stack development** in the future.
This approach allows me to **learn by building**, making the journey both meaningful and rewarding, while resulting in the outcome of a practical and engaging project.
